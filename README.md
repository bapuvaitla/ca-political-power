## Data
Voting data, party registration data, American Community Survey (ACS) data, and shapefiles for 2012, 2014, 2016, and (soon) 2018 are in the year-labeled folders. Only 2016 data is currently formatted for analysis.

## Scripts
The **prep.R** script is self-contained; it downloads, reshapes, geographically harmonizes the data. The *sov_g16* table (generated by the script) has the voting data; the *reg_g16* table the party registration data; and the list of tables called *acs_16_prec* have all the ACS data (tens of thousands of variables, so split into 122 data tables. Note that the *acs_16_template_int* file is a codebook for all of those variables). The vote, reg, and ACS data can all be merged with the common ID field *srprec*. Note that the common geographical unit is voting precinct, not census block as I noted earlier; there are 20k+ voting precincts in California. 

## Analysis
The reg and ACS variables will be predictors for the party vote share variable.
