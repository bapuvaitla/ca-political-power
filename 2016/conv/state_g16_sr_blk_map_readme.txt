Description:	This file contains statewide SR precinct to Census block correspondances based on the proportion of registered voters geocoded to each precinct-block record. 
This file can be used to merge 2010 block or tract data to the 2016 General Election SR precincts as well as, to merge 2010 Census block or tract data to the 2016 General Election SR precincts.

The Census blocks are from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 TIGER/Line and are the smallest statistical reporting areas for decennial Census data.
